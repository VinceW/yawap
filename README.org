Yet Another Wireless Access Point

** What

Creates a Wireless Access Point

** How

Download the YaWAP repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/vincew/yawap.git
#+END_SRC

Change into the YaWAP directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd yawap
#+END_SRC

Edit the YaWAP script to match your configuration.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nano yawap.sh
#+END_SRC
Most likely you only need to adapt the AP_DEVICE and the WAN_DEVICE
variables.

Run the YaWAP script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./yawap.sh
#+END_SRC
run the commands at the end of the script (see screen output) in seperate
terminal windows (each command in it's own window).
